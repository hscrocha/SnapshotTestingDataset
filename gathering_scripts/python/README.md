SnapShot Testing Collection Python Script

Portions:
1. GetReposJestToCSV.py
2. fullInfo.py
3. testFileCounter.py

You will Need:
1. Python, git installed, a Github token (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token), and GitTrends Proxy Server (https://github.com/gittrends-app/github-proxy-server)

These scripts are split into three parts. 
1. GetReposJestToCSV.py fetches the repositories by query from Github itself and saves it to a CSV along with some basic information
2. Because we wanted to be open to extensions on the attributes we were gathering, fullInfo.py reads the Github URL from the spreadsheet generated by GetReposJestToCSV.py and obtains the attributes from there. Splitting up the process allowed us to finalize which attributes we were looking for and how to formulate it on the spreadsheet. 
3. We later decided to include the number of both test and snapshot files. testFileCounter.py retrieves the number of snapshot or general test files depending on which query you use and appends it to a spreadsheet of your choice. 

GetReposJestToCSV.py:

Takes a query and segments it by star increments to bypass the API limit. Records basic information about a repo, checks whether .snap files exist in the repos, and records relevant information into a spreadsheet for later use

Notes on GetReposJestToCSV.py:
- Since there are many attributes of the queries used and the exact ones were not set in stone yet, it was much faster and more efficient for me to hardcode them into the program itself instead of inputting values at every run. 
- Additionally, as to not overflow past the API limit, the query has to be further broken down by star count increments. Repositories are added in increments of 0-10 stars, 10-100 stars, 1000-10000 stars, so on. The incrementation also makes the hardcoded option easier, as we could edit the starting increments depending on how much of the data we needed if we wanted to obtain part of the dataset. 

Queries Used:
- 'language:javascript topic:jest sort:stars-desc stars:{}..{}'.format(loopend,loopstart)
- 'language:TypeScript topic:jest sort:stars-desc stars:{}..{}'.format(loopend,loopstart)

fullInfo.py:

Using the information provided by the the spreadsheet generated from GetReposJestToCSV.py, fullInfo.py takes the GitHub URL provided and retrieves the necessary attributes from each repo and outputs it into a spreadsheet

Notes on fullInfo.py:

- The attributes are hardcoded, since there are too many attributes recorded to manually input efficiently each time, and the list of attributes we would include were not yet finalized. 


testFileCounter.py:

 testFileCounter.py retrieves the number of snapshot or general test files depending on which query you use and appends it to a spreadsheet of your choice. 

 Queries:
 - "filename:test repo:{}".format(text) - if looking for the number of general test files
 - "extension:snap repo:{}".format(text) - if looking for number of .snap test files specifically
